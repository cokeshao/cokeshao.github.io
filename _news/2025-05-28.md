`[Preprint]` We introduce [HoliTom](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21334), a training-free holistic token merge method for fast video LLMs, which accelerates video LLMs inference without compromising performance, achieving **99.1%** performance retention while reducing FLOPs to just **7%**. The [code](https://github.com/cokeshao/HoliTom) is open-source and ready for use.
