I am <span style="font-weight: 500">Kele Shao 邵可乐</span>, an incoming Ph.D. student at ENCODE Lab, Westlake University, where I will be advised by [Prof. Huan Wang](https://huanwang.tech/) in a joint program with Zhejiang University. Currently, I am completing my final year of undergraduate studies at the [College of Control Science and Engineering](http://www.cse.zju.edu.cn/cseenglish/main.htm), Zhejiang University, while also enrolled in the Advanced Honor Class of Engineering Education at [Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/).

My research interests center on Efficient AI and Machine Learning Systems (MLSys), with a focus on developing innovative approaches for model compression and acceleration. My research interests span efficient deep learning techniques across computer vision, large language models (LLMs), and embodied AI domains. The primary goal is to design and deploy resource-efficient AI systems that bridge the gap between academic research and real-world applications.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
