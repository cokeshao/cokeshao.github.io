I am Kele Shao (邵可乐), an incoming Ph.D. student at ENCODE Lab, [Westlake University](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/), where I will be advised by [Prof. Huan Wang](https://huanwang.tech/) in a joint program with [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). Currently, I am completing my final year of undergraduate studies at the [College of Control Science and Engineering](http://www.cse.zju.edu.cn/cseenglish/main.htm), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), while also enrolled in the Advanced Honor Class of Engineering Education at [Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/).

My research interests broadly encompass Efficient AI and Computer Vision.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
